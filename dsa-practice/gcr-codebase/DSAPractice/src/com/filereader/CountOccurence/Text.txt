Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995 (now owned by Oracle). It is designed with a "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) philosophy, meaning that compiled Java code can run on any device that supports a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) without needing to be rewritten for specific hardware. 
As of 2026, Java remains a cornerstone of the global technology landscape, currently powering billions of devices—from smartphones and smart TVs to enterprise servers and supercomputers. 
Core Characteristics

    Object-Oriented: Java organizes code around "objects"—real-world entities with state and behavior—and "classes," which serve as blueprints for those objects.
    Platform Independence: Programs are compiled into an intermediate format called bytecode, which is executed by the JVM rather than the computer's processor directly.
    Automatic Memory Management: It features a Garbage Collector that automatically handles the allocation and deallocation of memory, reducing common errors like memory leaks.
    Robust and Secure: Java emphasizes safety with strong type-checking, exception handling, and security features like sandboxing to prevent unauthorized code from accessing the host system. 

Common Uses
Java is a versatile language used across many industries: 

    Mobile Development: It is the primary foundation for Android applications.
    Enterprise Software: Used by major organizations (including Amazon, Netflix, and LinkedIn) for high-scale backend systems, billing, and supply chain management.
    Web Applications: Powers server-side logic for dynamic websites using frameworks like Spring and Hibernate.
    Big Data & AI: Used in data processing engines like Apache Kafka and Hadoop, as well as machine learning libraries.
    Internet of Things (IoT): Programs sensors and edge devices due to its portability and network-centric nature. 

Key Components

    JDK (Java Development Kit): The full set of tools needed to write and compile Java programs.
    JRE (Java Runtime Environment): A smaller package that includes the JVM and core libraries necessary only to run Java applications.
    JVM (Java Virtual Machine): The engine that interprets or compiles bytecode into machine-specific instructions for the operating system. 

Editions of Java
Oracle maintains several editions tailored to different environments: 

    Java SE (Standard Edition): The core platform used for desktop and general-purpose applications.
    Java EE (Enterprise Edition): Built on top of SE, specifically for large-scale, secure enterprise networks.
    Java ME (Micro Edition): Optimized for small devices with limited resources, like early mobile phones.
    JavaFX: A platform for creating rich internet applications with modern graphical user interfaces.
